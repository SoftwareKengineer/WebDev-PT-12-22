<!-- # index.html: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor, create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your test-site folder.
# images folder: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called images, inside your test-site folder.
# styles folder: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style your content (for example, setting text and background colors). Create a folder called styles, inside your test-site folder.
# scripts folder: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). Create a folder called scripts, inside your test-site folder.
# Copy the image you chose earlier into your images folder.
# Open up your index.html file, and insert the following code into the file exactly as shown. Don't worry about what it all means for now â€” we'll look at the structures in more detail later in the series.
# The line <img src="" alt="My test image"> is the HTML code that inserts an image into the page. We need to tell the HTML where the image is. The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory as index.html. To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need is images/your-image-filename. For example, our image is called firefox-icon.png, so the file path is images/firefox-icon.png.
# Insert the file path into your HTML code between the double quote marks of the src="" code.
# Save your HTML file, then load it in your web browser (double-click the file). You should see your new webpage displaying your image! 
# To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. my-image.jpg.
# To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, e.g. subdirectory/my-image.jpg.
# To link to a target file in the directory above the invoking HTML file, write two dots. So for example, if index.html was inside a subfolder of test-site and my-image.jpg was inside test-site, you could reference my-image.jpg from index.html using ../my-image.jpg.
# You can combine these as much as you like, for example ../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg. -->
